Raw Data Error - No errors found.
Check by using the following code and ensuring all elements were zero. If all elements are zero,
then the matrix is skewed correctly.
  industry = "Other"
  mainData = loadIndexDataLOGReturn(industry, path)
  mainDataArr = Array(mainData[:,1:end-2])
  checkArr=zeros(10,1)
  for i=1:10
    checkArr[i] = countnz(mainData[1:end-1,29]-mainData[2:end,i])
  end
